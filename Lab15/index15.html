        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <div class="minor-section">
            <p>I had to some issues about having to understand what or how to add an API. 
                I thought after the doc of the web was needed until I saw it wasn't adding to the html. 
             I tried inputting other website but still nothing was done. What helped most was having to ask for help because I felt 
            this lab was challenging for me to understand. I was missing a lot to make the web work again.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <div class="minor-section">
            <p>As a result, I was able to figure out how I needed tp add my API to have user to able to click 
                for a joke to come up. It got easier the more I was where my error was at. Everytime the user clicks on the 
                button, another joke comment appears. 
            </p>
