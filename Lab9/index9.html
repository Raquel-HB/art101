					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Having to test around with using JQuery and creating the button function on to our page.</p>
					<button id="changeColorButton">Change Color and Click Again</button>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<button id="makeSpecialButton">make special</button>
					<p> Some of of the issues were I didn't really understand on where to start and how to make 
						the button function to work on to my HTML page. I had to look into discord, JQuery web, and even ChatGBT. Once I was able 
					to make something work, I was able to tend explore other ideas to make different effect. Each of them contains something to have fun with.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Result</h2>
					<p> As a result, I created these things with the help of the resources around me. I had to keep trying and backing away from 
						stressing myself out. It took over 2 days to final understand and take things slow rather than having to go at a fast pace. For sure, this assignment was
					hard to understand since I didn't know how it should on to the pafe.  </p>
