		<h1> Hello World</h1>
		<p> Hello, hello! My name is Raquel and I am a third-year art major. I used to have experinces in coding back in middle school 
		but because loss of interest, I pretty much forgot everything. Starting this was a bit hard, took some time off but I got it at the end. 
		Some things about me are: I love raccoons, rats, and cats. I love having to spend time drawing and collecting stickers to gives these drawing 
		a bit of a spice. Overall, I'm excited to learn more about having to design things in the future. </p>
