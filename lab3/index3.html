  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p1> Some of the challenges I had faced were most of my links weren't working to link together again.
    I've tried many times until at last it worked. I also had trouble with the photo since it kept bursting out many sizes.
  </p1>

  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p1> I found out why my link wasn't working. I've thought it was my code causing the issue but turns out 
    github was the one creating the issue without wanting to publish and recently had to update it.
  </p1>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p1> It was not that hard and I was able to know how to link my website. As of now, I'm able to understand much more of CSS,
    I hope I get to understand the next lab but this project was nice to review and work on again.</p1>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p1> As a results of my work, everything seems to work out better. I always love to work with color and making the page 
    look really nice!</p1>
