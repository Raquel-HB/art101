       <h1> Hello World</h1>
<p> Hello, hello! My name is Raquel and I am a third-year art major. I used to have experinces in coding back in middle school 
but because loss of interest, I pretty much forgot everything. Starting this was a bit hard, took some time off but I got it at the end. 
Some things about me are: I love raccoons, rats, and cats. I love having to spend time drawing and collecting stickers to gives these drawing 
a bit of a spice. Overall, I'm excited to learn more about having to design things in the future. </p>

  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p> Some of the challenges I had faced were most of my links weren't working to link together again.
    I've tried many times until at last it worked. I also had trouble with the photo since it kept bursting out many sizes.

  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p> Not much problems so far since many of think were more of a review.

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p> It was not that hard and I was able to know how to link my website. As of now, I'm able to understand much more of CSS,
    I hope I get to understand the next lab but this project was nice to review and work on again.

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p> As a results of my work, everything seems to work out better. I always love to work with color and making the page 
    look really nice!
