       <h1> Hello World</h1>
<p> Hello, hello! My name is Raquel and I am a third-year art major. I used to have experinces in coding back in middle school 
but because loss of interest, I pretty much forgot everything. Starting this was a bit hard, took some time off but I got it at the end. 
Some things about me are: I love raccoons, rats, and cats. I love having to spend time drawing and collecting stickers to gives these drawing 
a bit of a spice. Overall, I'm excited to learn more about having to design things in the future. </p>

  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p1> Some of the challenges I had faced were most of my links weren't working to link together again.
    I've tried many times until at last it worked. I also had trouble with the photo since it kept bursting out many sizes.
  </p1>

  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p1> I found out why my link wasn't working. I've thought it was my code causing the issue but turns out 
    github was the one creating the issue without wanting to publish and recently had to update it.
  </p1>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p1> It was not that hard and I was able to know how to link my website. As of now, I'm able to understand much more of CSS,
    I hope I get to understand the next lab but this project was nice to review and work on again.</p1>

<div class="minor-section">
  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p1> As a results of my work, everything seems to work out better. I always love to work with color and making the page 
    look really nice!</p1>
