        <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h1>
        <p> Creating a functions that involves around on Conditionals. </p>

        <h2>Problems</h1>
        <p> Creating this new form of adding in more from our last pervious lessons, it was easy to understand and 
            knowing how to work with creating the sortingHat functions. I had fun seeing how we could mess around with 
            sorting and designing texts to make this result to be nice. 
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h1>
        <p>As a result, my sortingHat code worked and I was able to show the result after the user added the their names. 
            Although, I can't wait to see how I could try using this for my group project when having to make up something about meal prep!
