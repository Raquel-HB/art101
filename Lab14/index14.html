    <h1> Lab 14: Debugging</h1>
    <h2> Challenges</h2>
 <div class="minor-section">
    <p> Today challenge is debugging some of the mistake created through our labs. 
    </p>
</div>


    <h3> Problems </h3> 
    <div class="minor-section">
    <p> Although I didn't have much problem over the labs, there was some of the things I had to fix which were minor mistakes.
        I checked a few labs that had to be revise over the issues of some of the functions missing or having to just make it more neat since it was a little 
        hard to know what we're looking at. 
    </p>
</div>

    <h4>  Results</h4>
    <div class="minor-section">
    <p> As a result, I got to fix most of my lab by having input home pages, add in some missing var texts number from Lab 8, and editing the file structures 
        for both lab 2 and 3. It'll be show on the google doc where exacty was mistake was. 
  <ul>     
<li>-  Lab 3 -
      Some issues I had to fix this page was I didn't provide another page to take some of lab to the homepage.
      So I had to change lab 2 to be my main page while then changing 3 to be the reflection to then provided the main page to have all the other labs linked. /li>  
 <li>  - Lab 4- 
      The slash lines // were a little mess up and hard to view to to change it, I edited the text to not contain any wide spaces so all text aline straight. </li>
 <li> - Lab 8- 
      I was missing my function that had the console printing instead of providing the function. To which was pointed out by my TA to help fixed the issue.
      It was the function of subtracting the number during the first line, "console.log("subtracting 10 to the array:", numArray );"</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
