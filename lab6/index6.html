            <h1> Lab 5: Data Types and Variables </h1>
        <h2> Problems</h2>
            <p> There was no problem with this coding, luckily everything was easy with this one!
            </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h2>
            <p> As of now, no challenges, most things were the same on what to do and just adding a new javascript information. 
            </p>
        <h3> Results</h3>
             <p> As a result, I got to make my page without having to redo stuff. I didn't get stuck on any of things and things went smoothly. </p>
