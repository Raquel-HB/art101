        <h3>Challenges</h2>
        <div class="minor-section">
            <p>Today challenege is processing JSON from an API. Through this, we have to use XKCS comic to create the javascript and the output for results. 
                 </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <div class="minor-section">
            <p> Some problems I had was my image wasn't when I kept trying to work the javascript. Luckily, I was guided and 
                turns out is was exactly the same code that was used on Lab 14. Except there was some things I had to change and have another app 
                to helps process to print out. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Results</h4>
        <div class="minor-section">
            <p>As a result, the JSON and the APIs were able to function on to my website. The images are starting to show up and the consoles seems to show it is functioning well. 
                It works whenever the little bug with a c is turn on for everythng to work out.
            </p>
