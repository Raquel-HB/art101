            <h1> Lab 5: Data Types and Variables </h1>
        <h2> Problems</h2>
            <p> I didn't really face much problem for this assignments, it was
                a easy step to help figure things out.
            </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h2>
            <p> As for challenges, I say it would be where I had to create
                the javascript code but because it seems easy to catch up, I was able 
                to get the hang of it.
            </p>
        <h3> Results</h3>
             <p> As a result, I was able to create the page the car images. Along with the details and 
                other listing needed. My page came out just how I wanted to look like! </p>
