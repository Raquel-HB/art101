        <h2>Challenges</h2>
     <div class="minor-section">
        <p> Some of the challenges were having to understand the topic at first. 
            I didn't know where to start or how to even add the name input but once I asked for help
            I was able to see that it's easy understand! Main focus was just having to understand Functions 
            and creating them to be input into our codes.

        <h3> Problems </h3> 
        <div class="minor-section">
        <p>Some of the problems were very small. Most just having to add extra thing that weren't really need. 
            Some of the other things were having to contain spelling mistakes. So as for problems, nothing too big.
