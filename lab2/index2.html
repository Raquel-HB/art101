       <h1> Hello World</h1>
<p> Hello, hello! My name is Raquel and I am a third-year art major. I used to have experinces in coding back in middle school 
but because loss of interest, I pretty much forgot everything. Starting this was a bit hard, took some time off but I got it at the end. 
Some things about me are: I love raccoons, rats, and cats. I love having to spend time drawing and collecting stickers to gives these drawing 
a bit of a spice. Overall, I'm excited to learn more about having to design things in the future. </p>
<h2>Lab X - Subject/Topic</h2>

  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p> Some of the challenges I had to face were having to simply open 
    a file at the start because I didn't know how or where to exactly start. 
    Once I started the heading, it got easier to understand but the CSS file was even more harder to me.
  </p>

  <h3>Problems</h3>
  <p> There was so many trials I had to do with the file of CSS. Even when I opened and linked it to the index file,
    it somehow wouldn't connect nor change the color of the font. I was stuck on it for hours and I kept on restarting on the coding.
    It wasn't until I had to do everything again and restart on a new file to then have it link together.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p> It was hard at first but once I traced back my steps it made things easier to understand. 
    I was worried about working on this without a partner but seeing how much I was able to do, I'm proud of myself of having to ask for help 
  during section and having to then test things on my own.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p> As a results of my work, everything seems to be nice. Even added a photo of my favorite animal that's so cute!</p>
